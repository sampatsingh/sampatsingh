# 👋 Hi, I’m Sampat Singh

## Engineering Team Lead | Full-Stack Architect | Solutions Architect

I’m a senior engineering leader with **10+ years** building and delivering **scalable SaaS platforms, enterprise web applications, and cloud-native systems**. I combine hands-on full‑stack engineering with systems-level architecture to drive measurable product and business outcomes — performance, reliability, and scalable delivery.

I lead cross-functional teams and own architecture, technical execution, and delivery outcomes, while mentoring engineers and promoting engineering best practices. My work spans cloud-native infrastructure, API-first systems, and applied AI/GenAI integrations to solve real-world problems.

I focus on clean architecture, cost‑aware cloud design, and long‑term maintainability to help teams ship high-quality software consistently.

## 🧠 What I Do Best

- Architect **secure, scalable, and high-performance systems**
- Design and build **API-first, microservice-based platforms**
- Lead **Agile execution**: sprint planning, code reviews, delivery ownership
- Mentor engineers and promote **engineering best practices**
- Optimize **performance, SEO, and system reliability**
- Apply **AI / GenAI (LLMs, RAG, automation)** to real-world products
